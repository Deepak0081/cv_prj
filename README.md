# cv_prj
===>A computer vision project use to recogonize number's in a hand written note.. using CNN..

=>used library like numpy opencv sklearn matplot keras pickle...

=>numpy to seperate every data sets and train the cv to recognize the pattern of number..

=>matplot to show the accuracy of the predicted number..

=>sklearn and keras are used for training and getting accurate prediction of the recognized number.. 


-->> have used a 1000 data set for each integer by which 99% accurate prediction is done..
